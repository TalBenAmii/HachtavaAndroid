## Overview

**Hachtava** is an Android application built in Java that serves as a user-friendly interface to a set of educational websites. These websites were developed to help children practice and learn Hebrew, English, and mathematics in an engaging and organized way.

The app acts as a companion tool that enhances the learning experience by providing account management, word list customization, and seamless redirection to the appropriate exercises on the corresponding websites.

## Features

- 🔤 **English and Hebrew Word Practice**  
  Users can create, save, and load their own vocabulary lists in Hebrew and English. These lists are used to launch targeted word practice sessions on the companion websites.

  Direct access to interactive math learning games and exercises built for children.

- 👤 **Account Management**  
  Includes sign-up and login screens. User data and word lists are stored securely using **Firebase**.

  Continuous use of Firebase for storing user accounts and syncing their Hebrew/English vocabulary lists.

- 📱 **Intuitive User Interface**  
  Includes:
  - Login/Register screens  
  - Word list management (create, save, load)  
  - Practice launcher for Hebrew/English

## Purpose

This app was developed to allow users, especially students, to easily interact with educational content built by the developer's cousin. While the core learning games are embedded on external websites, **Hachtava** acts as a **bridge** between the user and those services—simplifying access, organizing content, and personalizing learning.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** (Android development)
- **Firebase** (Authentication & Realtime Database)
- **Educational Web Tools** (External websites for practice)
